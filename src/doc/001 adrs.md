# 1. ADRs

Date: 15 Feb 2022

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

All technical decisions will be recored in markdown using ADR style. New developers to the project will be able to follow the decisions made.
