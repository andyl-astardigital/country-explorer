# 2. React

Date: 15 Feb 2022

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to choose a front end framework for the project.

## Decision

We will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) as it's well known, widely supported and is quick to implement. We'll use create-react-app as our starter template

## Consequences

The application will be written using modern React approaches including functional components and hooks.
