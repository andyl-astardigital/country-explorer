# 12. SEO and Performance

Date: 15 Feb 2022

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The key NFR for this project is SEO and performance. The metric is that our Lighthouse scores should be a minimum of 90%, ideally on first render.

## Decision

We use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) tools to make sure we are always sitting with an overall score if at least 90%.

## Consequences

We will always be at least 90% in lighthouse.
